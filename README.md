# GaltonBoard-Design (Python code)

An elementary python code developed for sizing a real Galton board. Theory reference: [Galton Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board)

# Requirements

Tested on Python 3.9.7 (previous versions should work as fine). \
Additional libraries needed: [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/), [random](https://pypi.org/project/random2/). \
\
A handmade Galton board (about A5 paper sheet size) resulting from this code is shown below. \

# How to use

Simply execute the `.py` script like any other Python program. \
It can be done either through a Python IDE, e.g. Spyder, or directly from the terminal as `python GaltonBoard-Design.py`. \
A 2D figure will pop-up showing the actual shape of the board, including the Gaussian distribution. Additional information can be extracted from the generated variables.

## How to design your own Galton board

Go through the code and edit the design parameters according to your needs. These include board size, spheres diameter and so on.
